Ginger Workflow Management System
---------------------------------

The goal of the project is to provide a system that can be used for automated workflow processing.
The Ginger WfMS can be used for simple data transfer jobs between two or more systems as well as for
complex scenarios with parallel tasks and condition based routing.
